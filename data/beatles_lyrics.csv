A Day in the Life,1,"I read the news today, oh boy"
A Day in the Life,2,About a lucky man who made the grade
A Day in the Life,3,And though the news was rather sad
A Day in the Life,4,"Well, I just had to laugh"
A Day in the Life,5,I saw the photograph
A Day in the Life,6,He blew his mind out in a car
A Day in the Life,7,He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A Day in the Life,8,A crowd of people stood and stared
A Day in the Life,9,They'd seen his face before
A Day in the Life,10,Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
A Day in the Life,11,"I saw a film today, oh boy"
A Day in the Life,12,The English Army had just won the war
A Day in the Life,13,A crowd of people turned away
A Day in the Life,14,But I just had to look
A Day in the Life,15,Having read the book
A Day in the Life,16,I'd love to turn you on
A Day in the Life,17,NA
A Day in the Life,18,"Woke up, fell out of bed"
A Day in the Life,19,Dragged a comb across my head
A Day in the Life,20,Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
A Day in the Life,21,And looking up I noticed I was late
A Day in the Life,22,Found my coat and grabbed my hat
A Day in the Life,23,Made the bus in seconds flat
A Day in the Life,24,Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
A Day in the Life,25,And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
A Day in the Life,26,"I read the news today, oh boy"
A Day in the Life,27,"4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire"
A Day in the Life,28,And though the holes were rather small
A Day in the Life,29,They had to count them all
A Day in the Life,30,Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
A Day in the Life,31,I'd love to turn you on
A Day in the Life,32,NA
